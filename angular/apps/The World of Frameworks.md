## **Runtime Environments**

* **Node.js** => Runtime Environment (V8 engine installed in system) - With this you can use JS language for backend (server-side) programming

## Frameworks

A framework is like a box of pre-defined (pre-created) tools that are available for your use. You can use those tools to do some work in an easier, more efficient and quicker manner. Basically, a framework makes your work easier.

### Server-side (Backend) Frameworks

Before backend frameworks, the server-side code of websites and applications was orgranized manually, was maintained or linked manually. Configurations were written manually as well. You also had to implement design patterns like MVC or active directory patterns manually.

After the advent of backend frameworks, it became easier and faster to create a robust server-side of a webiste or application. The framework took care of a lot of things which had to be done manually earlier, such as code organization, bundling, tranpiling, etc. 

Some popular backend frameworks are:

* **Express.js or Nest.js** => Server-side fraemworks for creating REST servers or APIs or web applications with JS programming language.
* **Ruby on Rails** => Server-side fraemwork for creating REST APIs or web applications with Ruby programming language.
* **Laravel** => Server-side fraemwork for creating REST APIs or web applications with PHP programming language.
* **Spring Boot** => Server-side fraemwork for creating REST APIs or web applications with Java programming language.
* **Django or Flask** => Server-side fraemworks for creating REST APIs or web applications with Python programming language.

### Client-side Frameworks

In contrast to server-side, client-side means the user's system. Client-side frameworks will involve HTML, CSS, and JS or their variants. 

Here are some different types of front-end frameworks:

#### * CSS Framework

A CSS framework is a pre-prepared that is meant to be used a base for starting a project. It provides a set of predefined styles, components, and layout options that help developers create web designs with minimal effort.

Examples of CSS frameworks:

* **Bootstrap**
* **Material UI**
* **Tailwind CSS**
* **Foundation**
* **Bulma**
* **Semantic UI**

#### * JavaScript Frameworks

JavaScript frameworks provide a structure and a set of abstractions for building complex and feature-rich web applications. They help developers manage code organization, state management, and user interactions more effectively. 

Some examples of popular JavaScript frameworks:

* **Angular** --> **Angular Universal**
* **React** --> **Next.js** (Framework of framworks/Hybrid framework), **Gatsby**
* **Vue.js** --> **Nuxt.js**
* **Ember**
* **Svelte** --> **SvelteKit**
* **Backbone.js**
