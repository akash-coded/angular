# Task: Online Store Management System UI/UX

## Description:

You have successfully implemented the logic for an Online Store Management System using TypeScript. Your next task is to create a visually appealing and functional user interface (UI) for the system using HTML, CSS, and Bootstrap. You will be designing a responsive web application that includes various pages and components to manage products, categories, customers, and orders.

   - Categories
   - Customers
   - Orders
3. Implement the following pages and their functionalities:

   a. Dashboard:

   - Display summary statistics (total products, categories, customers, and orders)
   - Show a list of recently added products
   - Display a list of the latest orders

   b. Products:

   - Add a new product (using a modal form)
     * Product Name
     * Price
     * Stock
     * Category (dropdown)
   - Edit product details (using a modal form)
   - Delete a product (with confirmation)
   - Search products by name (search bar)
   - Display product list with pagination, including:

   - Add a new customer (using a modal form)
     * Name
     * Email
   - Edit customer details (using a modal form)
   - Delete a customer (with confirmation)
   - Display customer list with pagination, including:
     * Name
     * Email

   e. Orders:

   - Display order list with pagination, including:
     * Order ID
     * Customer Name
     * Total Price
     * Order Date
     * Order Status (dropdown)
   - Update order status (using the dropdown menu in the order list)
4. Use Bootstrap components like cards, tables, modals, buttons, and forms to create a consistent and professional-looking UI.
5. Ensure the application is responsive, so it looks good on both desktop and mobile devices.
6. Implement proper error handling and user feedback, such as displaying alerts for successful or failed operations.
7. Implement a consistent color scheme and typography throughout the application to enhance the user experience and improve readability.
8. Use tooltips and popovers to provide additional information or guidance when necessary, such as explaining the purpose of a button or form field.
9. Create a footer section with copyright information and any relevant links, ensuring it is consistently displayed on all pages.
10. Use loading indicators or progress bars when performing actions that may take some time, such as loading data from the server or processing a request. This will help to manage user expectations and provide a more enjoyable experience.
11. Implement form validation to ensure that users enter the required information correctly before submitting. Display appropriate error messages when validation fails.
12. Use modals for confirmation dialogs when performing critical actions, such as deleting a product, category, or customer. This will help prevent accidental deletions and provide a more user-friendly experience.
13. Organize your application's code using a modular approach, separating the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into separate files and folders to maintain a clean and organized project structure.
14. Test your application thoroughly on multiple devices, screen sizes, and browsers to ensure a consistent and bug-free experience for all users.
15. Document your code using comments and provide a README file with instructions on how to set up and run your application, including any dependencies or build tools required.

By following these requirements and implementing the specified pages, components, and functionalities, you will create a professional, responsive, and user-friendly interface for your Online Store Management System. This will allow users to effectively manage products, categories, customers, and orders, and provide an enjoyable experience.

## Summary and Description of Pages:

1. Dashboard:
   The Dashboard is the main landing page of the Online Store Management System. It provides a quick overview of the system's key metrics, such as the total number of products, categories, customers, and orders. It also displays a list of recently added products and the latest orders, allowing users to keep track of recent activity and stay up-to-date with the system's status.

Approach: Use Bootstrap cards to display summary statistics and tables or lists for recently added products and latest orders. Consider using AJAX or Fetch API to update this information in real-time.

2. Products:
   The Products page is dedicated to managing the store's products. Users can add, edit, and delete products, as well as search for specific products by name. The product list should be paginated to handle large numbers of products efficiently.

Approach: Use a combination of Bootstrap tables, modals, and forms to create a user-friendly interface for managing products. Implement client-side form validation and provide appropriate feedback using alerts or notifications.

3. Categories:
   The Categories page allows users to manage the different product categories within the store. Users can add, edit, and delete categories, as well as view a list of categories with pagination.

Approach: Similar to the Products page, use Bootstrap tables, modals, and forms to provide a consistent user experience. Implement client-side form validation and provide appropriate feedback using alerts or notifications.

4. Customers:
   The Customers page is dedicated to managing the store's customers. Users can add, edit, and delete customers, as well as view a list of customers with pagination.

Approach: Use a similar approach as with the Products and Categories pages, employing Bootstrap tables, modals, and forms to create a consistent and user-friendly interface. Implement client-side form validation and provide appropriate feedback using alerts or notifications.

5. Orders:
   The Orders page displays a list of orders placed by customers, with pagination. Users can view order details, such as the customer's name, total price, order date, and order status. The order status can be updated directly from this page using a dropdown menu.

Approach: Use a Bootstrap table to display the list of orders and include dropdown menus for updating order status. Implement real-time updates to the order list using AJAX or Fetch API. Use tooltips or popovers to provide additional information about the order status options.
